  <articleContents><![CDATA[<p>React propTypes is one of my favourite feature in React. It gives me confidence of writing components which are easy to reuse. I always see this feature as analogous to contracts. If I define some required propTypes in your B components, I wish to have these props passed by my parent component A. And if the parent components successfully supply these props, child component would always render the desired output. This is the power of React propType checking. </p>]]></articleContents>
