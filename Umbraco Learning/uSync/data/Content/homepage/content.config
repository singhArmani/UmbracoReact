  <articleBodyText2><![CDATA[<p>When I started learning React, it was indeed a learning curve for me. I followed many video tutorials and read few books to understand how React really differs from other DOM manipulating libraries. </p>
<p>Believe me, learning the basic concepts was half the battle won. I was told that React emphasizes on creating reusable components but I was weak in implementing that concept- given a UI, I would dump everything in one component and thinking I am done. Well, that was wrong; I was on the way of learning React as a newly born baby learns to walk slowly. </p>

  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>React is a powerful declarative library and is becoming must have skill for all Front-End developers. As part of my web development career, learning React was very exciting; not only it teaches me how to make good use of functional programming but also how to approach my solution in a way which is more reusable and maintainable down the track. I appreciate the fact that I got to learn many things while developing few React and React Native projects. </p>
<p>I feel happy to share my experience with you guys and hope it could be worth of your time. </p>]]></bodyText>
